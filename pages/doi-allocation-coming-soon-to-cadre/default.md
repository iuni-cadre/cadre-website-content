title: ' DOI allocation coming soon to CADRE'

In a major step toward improving reproducibility in research, CADRE will allow users to begin allocating Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to their packages **on XX.**

===

CADRE’s packages, which can consist of data, code, and data-analysis tools, can be shared and reproduced among the CADRE community in the Marketplace. Attaching DOIs to packages [establishes data provenance and ensures reproducibility](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/blog/reproducibility-the-fourth-cadre-pillar) by documenting and archiving researchers’ computing environments, data, analyses, and software.

There are three tiers for CADRE’s DOI allocation:
1. Packages with permanent DOIs attached to them will be discoverable by everyone, whether or not they have a CADRE account.
2. Packages with temporary DOIs and metadata will be discoverable by those with a CADRE account. 
3. Packages with no DOI and metadata will only be discoverable by those with a CADRE account if the owner/creator chose to publish it

Publicly available DOIs allow users to cite the DOIs for their code or data in papers and give other researchers the opportunity to view or reproduce the work, [strengthening research overall](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2020.556282/full?=1&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Big_Data).

#### Attaching a DOI
If you’re ready to attach a DOI to your published package on CADRE, first publish the package in the Marketplace. You’ll see a link on your package asking if you’d like to add a DOI to your package. Once you click it, you’ll be asked to provide metadata about your package and then assigned a temporary DOI. 

In two  weeks, you will have the opportunity to make the DOI  permanent by agreeing to CADRE’s terms and rules. To learn how to create or reproduce a package on CADRE, [check out our demos](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources).
