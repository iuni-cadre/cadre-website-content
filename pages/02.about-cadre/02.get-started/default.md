CADRE is currently in alpha! Anyone is welcome to access CADRE's datasets and use the platform, which provides standardized text- and data-mining services for big datasets. As an alpha user, you can take advantage of [CADRE’s unique features](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre), including the:
* CADRE Query Builder, a user-friendly GUI query-builder that allows you to easily query datasets
* Jupyter Notebook coding environment, where you can build data-analysis and visualization tools
* Marketplace, where you will reproduce queries, tools, derived data, research results, workflows, and visualizations

Anyone may access the **Microsfot Academic Graph** dataset on the platform. CADRE’s [sponsoring partners](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) will additionally have access to the **Web of Science** dataset.

To learn how to work with CADRE, review our workshop and tutorial: [CADRE: A One-Stop Shop for Scholarly Data Access, Sharing, and Reproducible Computation](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/cadre-workshop-iu). You may also want to review the [CADRE Data Access Policy](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/data-access-policy).
