Anyone is welcome to access CADRE's open datasets and use the platform. Take advantage of [CADRE’s unique features](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre), including the:
* CADRE Query Builder, a user-friendly GUI query-builder that allows you to easily query datasets
* Jupyter Notebook coding environment, where you can build data-analysis and visualization tools
* Marketplace, where you will reproduce queries, tools, derived data, research results, workflows, and visualizations

Anyone may access the **Microsoft Academic Graph** dataset on the platform. CADRE’s [sponsoring partners](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) will additionally have access to the **Web of Science** dataset, which now includes [the latest Web of Science dataset](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/available-datasets) covering 1900 to 2019. If your institution currently owns the Web of Science, you can take part in a [CADRE Trial to access the dataset on our platform](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/request-a-trial).

To learn how to work with CADRE, check out some of our tutorials [on our Resources page](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources). You may also want to review the [CADRE Data Access Policy](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/data-access-policy).
