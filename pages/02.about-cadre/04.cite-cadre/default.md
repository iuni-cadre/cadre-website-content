When reporting research created while using CADRE, we ask that you use the following acknowledgement:

Research reported in this publication was developed using the Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment (CADRE) project ([http://doi.org/10.26313/rdy8-4w58](http://doi.org/10.26313/rdy8-4w58)). Thus, the authors received some support through CADREâ€™s funders. CADRE was developed with support from a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS; grant number LG-70-18-0202-18), including cost-share from the Big Ten Academic Alliance Library Initiatives (BTAA), Microsoft Research, the Web of Science Group, and academic university libraries (Ohio State University, Michigan State University, Purdue University, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Penn State University, University of Iowa and Rutgers University).

We also ask that you cite our project when publishing papers that use packages you've created on CADRE:
