CADRE addresses the IMLS' “National Digital Platform” priority area by addressing a critical emergent issue faced by academic libraries: providing sustainable, affordable, and standardized text- and data-mining services for licensed big datasets, as well as open and non-consumptive datasets too large or unwieldy to work with in existing research library environments. By sharing costs across a large number of academic libraries, CADRE will create a cloud-based solution for making these data available to its member institutions--with appropriate security, stewardship, and storage--at a fraction of what it would cost them to do alone.

This platform was built as part of the Shared BigData Gateway for Research Libraries (SBD-G) project, which is made possible by [a three-year IMLS grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-18-0202-18). The project is led by [Indiana University Libraries](https://libraries.indiana.edu/), in collaboration with the [Indiana University Network Science Institute](https://iuni.iu.edu/) and the [Big Ten Academic Alliance](http://www.btaa.org/). This project is additionally supported by a group of cross-industry partners that you can read more about [here](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us).

### Features ###
* **Access major datasets**: access Web of Science, Microsoft Academic Graph, and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data  
* **Private profile:** store query outputs, data-analysis tools, and research results in a profile  
* **CADRE Query Builder:** use this user-friendly GUI query-builder to easily query datasets  
* **Jupyter Notebook:** proficient coders can build data-analysis and visualization tools here  
* **Marketplace:** reproduce queries, tools, derived data, research results, workflows, and visualizations&mdash;and utilize what others share

### Datasets
When you use CADRE, you receive access to millions of academic publications and billions of citations from leading commercial datasets and major open datasets. And there is more to come. CADRE is built to be an agile, interdisciplinary platform that can consistently take on new datasets as different types of academic researchers come aboard. [Contact us](https://cadre.iu.edu/contact-us) with inquries about adding datasets.

Current datasets include:  
* Web of Science (covering 1900 through 2019): a leading commerical dataset that includes 73 million papers and 1.7 billion citations  
* Microsoft Academic Graph: an open bibliometric dataset that holds 208 million documents and 1.4 billion citations  
* U.S. Patent and Trademark Office: for access to 9 million patent application documents  

Only users from [our BTAA partner insitutions](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) have access to the Web of Science datasets. Interested in using our open data? Please read the [CADRE Data Access Policy](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/data-access-policy). You can then complete the [CADRE General Data User Application](https://iuni.iu.edu/resources/cadre/general-data-user). You can also review documentation for the datsets and our [CADRE Data Access Policy](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/data-access-policy) on our [Resources page](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources).

### Demos & Instructions
If you are a new user trying to learn more about how to work with the platform, visit our [Resources page](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources) to watch informational videos and demos. You will also learn how you can access data as general user and submit stories that will improve the CADRE platform.
