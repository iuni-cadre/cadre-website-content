 ![An illustration of map of different datasets, including Web of Science, USPTO and Microsoft Academic Graph.](illustration1.png?classes=float-right) We are currently building the CADRE platform, which will meet the text- and data-mining needs of academic researchers across any discipline. Instructions on accessing CADRE will be available soon. In the meantime, you can view demos on how the platform will work on our [Resources page](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources). And while we are not yet offering paid memberships to access our platform, you can gain early access and other perks by becoming a [CADRE Fellow](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship).

You can also read more about our datasets and our data access policy below. 

**Current datasets include:**
* Web of Science
* Microsoft Academic Graph
* U.S. Patent and Trademark Office


Documentation on the structure of these datasets is [available here](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/documentation). You can also read our [CADRE Data Access Policy](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/data-access-policy) and request access through the [CADRE General Data User Application](https://iuni.iu.edu/resources/cadre/general-data-user).

If you want to stay updated on CADRE and remain informed on when our services will become available, follow us on Twitter at [@CADRE_Project](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) and [subscribe](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events) to our newsletter.
