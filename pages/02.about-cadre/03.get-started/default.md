We are currently building the CADRE platform, which will meet the big data text- and data-mining needs of academic researchers across any discipline. Instructions on accessing CADRE will be available soon. 

To read more in-depth about the features our platform will offer, please visit the [introduction page](https://cadre.iu.edu/website/grav/about-cadre/introduction).

If you want to stay updated on CADRE and remain informed on when our services will become available, please email **cadre@iu.edu** to join our newsletter.
