title: 'Introduction to CADRE'
---

The Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment (CADRE) addresses the IMLS “National Digital Platform” priority by addressing a critical emergent issue faced by academic libraries: providing sustainable, affordable, and standardized text- and data-mining services for licensed, big datasets, as well as open and non-consumptive datasets too large or unwieldy to work within existing research library environments or with no commercially viable data-mining interface. The project team, led by Indiana University, will provide member institutions with a cloud-based solution for making such data available to members with the appropriate security, stewardship, and storage at a fraction of what it would cost them to do so alone. By sharing the cost of this solution across a large number of academic libraries, we will be able to provide a superior solution at a lower cost to members. 

CADRE's cloud-based infrastructure will feature standardized data formats for text- and data-mining. Data will be available in multiple formats in our CADRE Query Builder, including relational and graph database formats, as well as flat table and native formats. Users can save all of their work in a personal profile, but they can also reproduce queries, alogorithms, derived data, research results, workflows, and visualizations in the CADRE Marketplace. Anything shared in the CADRE Marketplace can be utilized by other researchers.

#### > Datasets ##### 
Our platform is currently seeded with a combination of open and licensed bibliometric datasets, including Microsoft Academic Graph and Web of Science. You can learn more about these datasets by visiting the [Available Datasets](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/available-datasets) page. You can also [review documentation](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/documentation) on the structure of both datsets, as well as our [CADRE Data Access Policy](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/data-access-policy).

#### > Demos & Instructions ####
If you are a new user trying to learn more about how to work with the platform, visit our [Resources page](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources) to watch informational videos and demos. You will also learn how you can access data as general user and submit stories that will improve the CADRE platfrom.

#### > CADRE Fellowship ####
While we are not yet offering paid membership to access CADRE, we did take on seven CADRE Fellowship teams who used our platform for their research. To read about our current fellows, visit our [CADRE Fellowship page](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship).

#### > Become a Partner ####
The CADRE platform was built as part of the Shared BigData Gateway for Research Libraries (SBD-G) project, which is made possible by [a two-year IMLS grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-18-0202-18). The project is led by [Indiana University Libraries](https://libraries.indiana.edu/), in collaboration with the [Indiana University Network Science Institute](https://iuni.iu.edu/) and the [Big Ten Academic Alliance](http://www.btaa.org/). You can learn more about [our partners](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) or how to become one by visting the [Work with Us](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) page.
