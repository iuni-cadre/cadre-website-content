CADRE is an IMLS-funded project that provides sustainable, affordable, and standardized text- and data-mining services for licensed big datasets, as well as open and non-consumptive datasets too large or unwieldy to work with in existing research library environments. CADRE offers academic researchers access to these data in a secure cloud-based platform.

**Features include:**
* Standardized data formats: for the Web of Science, Microsfot Academic Graph, and U.S. Patent & Trademark Office datasets
* Private profile: to store query outputs, data-analysis tools, and research results
* CADRE Query Builder: a query-builder with a graphical user interface for easy querying 
* CADRE Notebook: for proficient coders to build their own data-analysis tools 
* CADRE Marketplace: a place to reproduce queries, alogorithms, derived data, reasearh results, workflows, and visualizations&mdash;and to utilize what others share

This platform was built as part of the Shared BigData Gateway for Research Libraries (SBD-G) project, which is made possible by [a two-year IMLS grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-18-0202-18). The project is led by [Indiana University Libraries](https://libraries.indiana.edu/), in collaboration with the [Indiana University Network Science Institute](https://iuni.iu.edu/) and the [Big Ten Academic Alliance](http://www.btaa.org/).
