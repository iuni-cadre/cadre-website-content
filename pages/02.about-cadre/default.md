CADRE is an IMLS-funded project that provides sustainable, affordable, and standardized text- and data-mining services for licensed big datasets, as well as open and non-consumptive datasets too large or unwieldy to work with in existing research library environments. CADRE offers academic researchers access to these data in a secure cloud-based platform.

**Features include:**
* Access to major datasets: gain access to the Web of Science, Microsoft Academic Graph, and U.S. Patent & Trademark Office datasets
* Private profile: store query outputs, data-analysis tools, and research results in a profile
* CADRE Query Builder: where users can use a graphical user interface to make data available in both relational and graph database formats
* CADRE Notebook: where proficient coders can build their own data-analysis tools 
* CADRE Marketplace: where researchers can reproduce queries, tools, derived data, research results, workflows, and visualizations&mdash;and utilize what others share

This platform was built as part of the Shared BigData Gateway for Research Libraries (SBD-G) project, which is made possible by [a two-year IMLS grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-18-0202-18). The project is led by [Indiana University Libraries](https://libraries.indiana.edu/), in collaboration with the [Indiana University Network Science Institute](https://iuni.iu.edu/) and the [Big Ten Academic Alliance](http://www.btaa.org/).
