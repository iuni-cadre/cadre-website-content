title: Pricing
---

While CADRE is currently under development, the tiered-pricing model we plan to offer will create an affordable solution for all researchers and institutions. 

In the meantime, we invite you to collaborate with our team of experts and use our state-of-the-art big bibliometric data and cloud-computing environment for your next research project as a [CADRE Fellow](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship). You will gain free access to CADRE as a fellow and provide a valuable use case to the development of the platform.

To view demos on how the platform will work, visit our [Resources page](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources). To find documentation about our datasets, which will include the Web of Science, Microsoft Academic Graph, and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data, visit our [Documentation page](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/documentation). You can also read our [CADRE Data Access Policy](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/data-access-policy) and request access through the [CADRE General Data User Application](https://iuni.iu.edu/resources/cadre/general-data-user).

If you want to stay updated on CADRE and remain informed on when our services will become available, follow us on Twitter at [@CADRE_Project](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) and fill out [a contact form](https://cadre.iu.edu/contact-us) with a requst to join our newsletter.
