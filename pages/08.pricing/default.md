While CADRE is currently under development, the tiered-pricing model we plan to offer will create an affordable solution for all researchers and institutions. 

In the meantime, consider using CADRE at no cost as a general user during our [alpha phase](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/get-started).

If you want to stay updated on CADRE and remain informed on when our services will become available, follow us on Twitter at [@CADRE_Project](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) and [subscribe to our newsletter](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events).
