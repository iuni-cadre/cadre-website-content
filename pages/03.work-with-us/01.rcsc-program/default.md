In response to the [White House's call to action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/call-action-tech-community-new-machine-readable-covid-19-dataset/) for the scientific community to help answer COVID-19 questions with the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) of scholarly literature, the CADRE project has opened a special fellowship program for researchers who are working on coronavirus-related research. 

These researchers can take advantage of a special tier of service through CADRE's new Research Cohort for the Study of Coronaviruses Program (RCSC).

**As an RCSC researcher, you can:**
* Query across the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) of scholarly literature in its raw format and parsed into a relational database, which will be maintained and updated weekly
* Additionally query across CADRE's Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph datasets
* Use CADRE's cloud-computing resources; GUI query-builder; and Jupyter Notebook coding environment
* Receive intensive technical support for your work
* Present your research in the future as part of our [fellows webinar series](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship)

All of this can be done in [CADRE's cloud-based platform](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre).

##### Additional details
Applicants can form research teams consisting of graduate students, staff, and faculty from any U.S. or non-U.S. universityâ€”and teams can span any discipline and institution. You may also submit a research proposal without a team.

Currently, there is no deadline for proposal submissions, as we believe researchers who want access to this program are hoping to begin their work immediately. We plan to accept RCSC research teams as we are able to provide support.

Please [submit your proposal here](https://iuni.iu.edu/resources/datasets/cadre/research-cohort-proposal-form).

If you have any questions, you can [contact us here](https://cadre.iu.edu/contact-us).
