title: 'CADRE Fellowship'
---

To better understand what researchers will require from our platform, CADRE is running a fellowship program while the platform is under development. 

Those in the [CADRE Fellowship Program](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/news/meet-cadres-first-class-of-fellows) collaborate with our team of experts and use our state-of-the-art big bibliometric data and cloud-computing environment for their research projects. These fellows gain free access to CADRE while providing a valuable use case to the platform's development. 

Currently, our fellowship program is **closed** and we will not be taking on any new fellows in the coming months. Instead, we will begin allowing users to test the platform in alpha on Feb. 10.

However, you can be the first to know when our fellows will be presenting their work by following us on Twitter at [@CADRE_Project](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) and [subscribing](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events) to our newsletter.

##### Our fellows
Our eight fellowship teams span across disciplines and offer compelling research that incorporates big data and bibliometrics. These fellows traveled with the CADRE team to the 2019 [International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/cadre-workshop) in Rome and will present their work in webinars in 2020.
