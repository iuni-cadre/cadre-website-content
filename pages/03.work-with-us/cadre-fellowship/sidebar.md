title: 'CADRE Fellowship'
---

While CADRE is not yet offering paid memberships to use our platform, we invite you to collaborate with our team of experts and use our state-of-the-art big bibliometric data and cloud-computing environment for your next research project as a CADRE Fellow. You will gain free access to CADRE as a fellow and provide a valuable use case to the development of the platform.

CADRE Fellowship Program applicants can form research teams consisting of graduate students, staff, and faculty from any U.S. or non-U.S. universityâ€”and teams can span any discipline and institution. You may also submit a research proposal without a team. You do not need to have extensive programming experience to apply.

**Our previous fellows received:** 
* Travel support to present their work at ISSI 2019 in Rome,
* Free and early access to CADRE's cloud-computing resources,
* Access to big bibliometric datasets Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph,
* And training and technical support from our IT team for the CADRE platform and for their research projects.

Our call for CADRE Fellows remains open, and we select new fellows as opening become available. If you are interested in becoming a CADRE Fellow, email us at **cadre@iu.edu** or fill out [a proposal form](https://iuni.iu.edu/resources/cadre/fellowship-proposal-form). You can also be the first to know when we are accepting new fellows by following us on Twitter at [@CADRE_Project](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) and emailing us with a request to join our newsletter.
