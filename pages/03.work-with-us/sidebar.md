We are designing CADRE to be an agile, interdisciplinary tool for any academic researcher who performs text- and data-mining on large datasets. CADRE is built upon collaborative partnerships and shared resources. We are thankful to all of the partners that have a hand in CADRE. 

Whether you are a researcher, an institution, or a data publisher, you can learn more about how to work with us below. [Contact us](https://cadre.iu.edu/contact-us) with any questions or requests.

#### Become a CADRE Fellow ####
While CADRE is under development, we invite you to collaborate with our team of experts and use our state-of-the-art big bibliometric data and cloud-computing environment for your next research project as a CADRE Fellow. Visit our [fellowship page](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship) to learn more.

#### Contribute to CADRE ####
This platform was built as part of the Shared BigData Gateway for Research Libraries (SBD-G) project, which is made possible through [a two-year IMLS grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-18-0202-18). The project is led by [Indiana University Libraries](https://libraries.indiana.edu/), in collaboration with the [Indiana University Network Science Institute](https://iuni.iu.edu/) and the [Big Ten Academic Alliance](http://www.btaa.org/).

The[ Web of Science Group](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic/) generously donated datasets, training resources, and other resources to our team. These two partners also helped fund our [fellowship program](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship), including sending fellow teams to [ISSI 2019](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/rome). 

If you are an organization interested in contributing datasets, resources, or partnering with us in any other way, please [contact us](https://cadre.iu.edu/contact-us) or email us at <a href = "mailto: cadre@iu.edu">c a d r e @ i u . e d u.</a>
