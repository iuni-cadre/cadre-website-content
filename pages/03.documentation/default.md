We are currently building the CADRE platform, which will meet the text- and data-mining needs of academic researchers across any discipline. Documentation on how to use CADRE will be available soon.

To read more in-depth about the features our platform will provide, please visit the [introduction page](https://cadre.iu.edu/website/grav/about-cadre/introduction).

If you want to stay updated on CADRE and remain informed on when our services will become available, follow us on Twitter at [@CADRE_Project](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) and email **cadre@iu.edu** with a request to join our newsletter.
