title: 'CADRE adding USPTO data to the platform'

The latest dataset is making its way to CADRE: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data will be available for easy querying [on the Gateway](https://cadre.iu.edu/gateway/profile) on April 15, 2021.

===

The dataset is part of CADRE’s free tier, so everyone will gain access to 7.4 million patent application documents from 1976 to 2020, which include titles, abstracts, and referenced works. 

Those researchers focused on intellectual property, innovation, and collaboration, among other topics, may be interested in this dataset. Open and accessible government datasets also contribute to better transparency and accountability in government agencies.

Now that USPTO data is available on the platform, users will be able to run CADRE’s GUI query builder and data-analysis and -visualization tools on the data. We’ll show researchers how to use CADRE to mine USPTO data at [our webinar on April 22](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/mine-u-s-patent-and-trademark-office-data-with-cadre).

#### Coming soon
Next up, that CADRE team will be working on functionality that allows users to attach Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to their packages, making the research citable and reproducible. We’ll also be updating our Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph datasets and [finalizing a querying enhancement](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/blog/new-querying-enhancements-coming-soon) that allows users to perform an address search against datasets to track publications from their own institutions’ authors. Stay tuned!

CADRE wants to continue to add datasets that are useful for our researchers and partner institutions. Do you have a dataset you’d like to be considered for CADRE? [Let us know](https://cadre.iu.edu/contact-us/feedback).
