Researchers will perform a comparative analysis on papers published in four mathematical biology legacy journals and on newer journals with different publication models and disciplinary scope.

===

The team will use the CADRE datasets to develop methodologies for comparative bibliometrics and content analyses; provide insight into publication trends in theoretical and applied domains; give authors new factors to consider when trying to publish; and help editors in similar disciplines use informatics to distinguish their journals.
