Samuelâ€™s project uses reference and citation aging, bibliographic coupling, and network breadth and depth to find similarities and differences between research fields in mathematics and the sciences.

===

Specifically, they will find how information ages differently across disciplines, generate data about changes in the development of these research fields, and study how actively collaborative the disciplines are. Samuel will use WoS data from 1900 to 2017 to perform these analyses, which have typically only been done on a smaller scale in a single discipline.
