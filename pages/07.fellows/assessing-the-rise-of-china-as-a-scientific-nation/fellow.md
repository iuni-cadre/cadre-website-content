This project is part of a series of studies in which researchers are assessing the rise of China in scholarship. In particular, the project aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the nature of China's publications in science and engineering over the past 20 years. 

===

One part of the study will be to examine the published scholarship from China and by Chinese nationals abroad. This will include case studies of specific fields, as well as macro overviews of the output, its impact, and the collaborations involved in China's rise. The team will use Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph to perform this research.
