The research team seeks to find the “deeper” and “broader” impact of network-based citation measurements in the scientific community. This project will determine the citation impact of scientific publications using an ego-centered citation network.

===

Ego-centered citation networks contain the citing relationships between a publication and its citing publications, as well as the relationships within its citing publications. Researchers will use the entirety of the WoS and MAG data to establish empirical evidence in this project.
