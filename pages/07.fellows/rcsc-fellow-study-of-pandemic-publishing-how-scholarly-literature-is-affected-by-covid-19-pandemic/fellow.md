This project will address the quality of recently published COVID-19 publications. The team says COVID-19 related research is being performed and published hastily, adding that turnaround times for medical journal publications have decreased by almost 50 percent. Speedy research and condensed publication timelines contribute to a lack of scientific rigor and increase the likelihood of corrections and retractions, leading to the spread of false information in trusted journals. 

Researchers will study the quality of COVID-19 related scholarly works by using CADREâ€™s datasets to identify signs of incoherency, irreproducibility, and haste. That includes analyzing COVID-19 published literature for incoherent writing, stylistic errors, plagiarism, speculative language, unreproducible experiments, and far-fetched conclusions based on poor quality data. The team will also examine retracted and corrected manuscripts and explore their citation maps to understand how errors propagate through scholarly literature. The team hopes their research will help others find the balance between expediting publication timelines and maintaining research quality.
