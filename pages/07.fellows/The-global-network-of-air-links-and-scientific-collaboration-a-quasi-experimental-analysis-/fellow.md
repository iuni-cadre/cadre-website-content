Researchers plan to determine the impact of the introduction and availability of long-distance flights on international scientific collaboration. The team will measure collaboration through co-authorship and co-affiliation.

They will also geocode publication affiliations from WoS and MAG from 1998 through 2017. This quasi-experimental research will apply state-of-the-art causal modeling techniques and explore how data-driven causality can enhance science of science policy relevance.
