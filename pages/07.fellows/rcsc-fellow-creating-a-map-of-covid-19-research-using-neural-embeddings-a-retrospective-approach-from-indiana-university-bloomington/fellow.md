This project will create a map of papers on COVID-19 that will be compared with maps for similar viruses, such as SARS and influenza, to better understand unexplored and concentration areas in the research. Kojaku will employ neural embedding methods, used to project research papers onto a low dimensional space using citations and semantic information, and then compare the density of papers on COVID-19 with other diseases. 

Kojaku says this research will both address unexplored areas that may deserve more attention and allow researchers to easily explore research related to COVID-19. Kojaku is part of the Science Genome project, which is a close CADRE collaborator, and says he will use CADRE to access the comprehensive, continuously updated CORD-19 dataset and related research, as well as to receive support from CADREâ€™s technical team and access to its computing resources.
