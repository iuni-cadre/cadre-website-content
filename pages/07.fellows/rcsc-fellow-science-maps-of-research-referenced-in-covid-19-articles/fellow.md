These researchers plan to address the recent flood of COVID-19 studies into preprint repositories. The sudden influx makes it difficult for researchers to stay on top of research that is relevant to their particular field using metrics or citations. The research team proposes a network-driven study that summarizes the fields related to recent COVID-19 literature. They will accomplish this by building citation networks among the most recent studies and applying community detection and keyword extraction to understand how the literature is organized. 

The researchers say that automated methods for summarizing COVID-19 research, as well as interactive visualizations, will aid other researchers in finding the most relevant and recent research in their field. The team will use CADRE's unified environment for access to scholarly datasets to accelerate their research.
