This project will build on the WoS report “Navigating the Structure of Research on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG),” as the researchers search for patterns of global collaboration and support the United Nations’ SDG call for action.

===

Researchers will design a prototype to analyze and visualize the input-output of partnerships over time in SDG-supportive research. They also plan to create a scoring measure or partnership index that defines and conducts partnership analytics for SDGs by using data sourced from WoS and MAG.
