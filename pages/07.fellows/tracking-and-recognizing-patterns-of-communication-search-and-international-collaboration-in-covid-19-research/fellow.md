This research team plans to study the international collaborations that are forming to perform COVID-19 research. The researchers say the combination of an intense research focus and a demand for quick results provides a rare opportunity for social scientists who study collaboration, teaming, and science dynamics. The team added that the abundant informal communications and knowledge sharing among scientists to address COVID-19 is rare. 

All of these circumstances have created an opportunity for the researchers to study team formations in real-time with CADRE. They plan to take advantage of CADREâ€™s datasets and technical team for their research.
