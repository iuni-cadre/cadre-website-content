We are designing CADRE to be an agile, interdisciplinary tool for any academic researcher who performs text- and data-mining on large datasets. While we are currently building the platform, we still want to hear from researchers, prospective users, and potential partners on what you want to see in CADRE.

If you have a request for datasets, data-analysis tools, other features&mdash;or if you are interested in partnering with CADRE&mdash; please email us at **cadre@iu.edu**.

To read more in-depth about the features our platform will provide, please visit the [introduction page](https://cadre.iu.edu/website/grav/about-cadre/introduction).

If you want to stay updated on CADRE and remain informed on when our services will become available, follow us on Twitter at [@CADRE_Project](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) and email **cadre@iu.edu** with a request to join our newsletter.
