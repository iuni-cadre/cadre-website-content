**Feb. 9, 2021**  
The first [CADRE Fellow](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship) team has published the research they conducted using the platform in _[Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2020.612442/full)_ today.

===

The research is called "[MCAP: Mapping Collaborations and Partnerships in SDG Research](https://cadre.iu.edu/fellows/mapping-collaborations-and-partnerships-in-sdg-research)," and the team includes five fellows from Michigan State University. The team used bibliometric methods and network analysis with CADRE's Microsoft Academic Graph dataset to study research output and collaboration supporting the the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The researchers also perform analysis to assess collaboration beyond multiple, one-time co-authorship.
