**Dec. 1, 2020**  
The [Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment](https://cadre.iu.edu/) (CADRE) is thrilled to announce its first international partner. [University of Toronto Libraries](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/), which is the largest academic library system in Canada, will join ten [Big Ten Academic Alliance](https://www.btaa.org/) (BTAA) libraries supporting the project.

![Logo that reads: University of Toronto Libraries.](FinalLogo1.jpg?classes=float-right)The BTAA and the [Indiana University Network Science Institute](https://iuni.iu.edu/) serve as major partners on CADRE, led by [Indiana University Libraries](https://libraries.indiana.edu/).

Researchers at University of Toronto Libraries were introduced to CADRE through the project’s [three-month, free trial period](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/request-a-trial). The trial gives a university’s researchers access to CADRE’s high-quality, standardized version of the Web of Science through their institutional access to the dataset. The opportunity to trial CADRE is crucial to better understand the platform’s value before committing to the project.

Marcel Fortin, the Head of the Map and Data Library and Advisor on Data Science and Digital Research at University of Toronto Libraries, says CADRE will give the institution’s researchers important data access and data-mining tools. 

“Providing CADRE’s standardized text- and data-mining services for big datasets to our researchers will expand on the world-class resources already available to our community through the University of Toronto Libraries,” Fortin said. “We were excited about the opportunity to trial CADRE, which allowed us to take advantage of the platform while evaluating its value to our researchers.”

University of Toronto researchers access CADRE’s proprietary tier of service, which includes [features and datasets](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre) recently upgraded in [CADRE’s beta launch](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/news/cadre-executes-beta-launch-invites-institutions-to-trial-platform).

#### Strengthening the CADRE Community
The latest partnership strengthens CADRE’s sustainability and affordability and spreads its mission beyond one academic consortium and across borders as demand grows for a service like CADRE. Academic libraries increasingly face the same obstacles: it is too costly and requires resources libraries do not have to clean and host big bibliometric datasets or offer a viable data-mining interface to researchers. 

CADRE helps libraries overcome these barriers by pooling resources across institutions to build a cloud-based infrastructure for hosting big data and create a user-friendly interface that [empowers researchers to perform big data analytics](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2020.556282/full). 

“As subscribers of Web of Science XML data, we realized CADRE had done all the heavy lifting of creating an environment that would allow for easy querying and analyzing of the data,” Fortin said. “Additionally, coming onboard as a CADRE partner opened the door to more extensive research collaboration with our new Big Ten partners.”

CADRE’s success relies on the users who contribute to it. A growing [community of partner institutions](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2020.556282/full) lowers costs for everyone while raising the bar for quality through shared resources and contributions.

The list of CADRE’s other [BTAA library partners](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) includes:
* Michigan State University Libraries
* Ohio State University Libraries
* Penn State University Libraries
* Purdue University Libraries
* Rutgers University Libraries
* University of Iowa Libraries
* University of Maryland Libraries
* University of Michigan Libraries
* University of Minnesota Libraries

#### About CADRE
CADRE addresses a critical emergent issue faced by academic libraries: providing sustainable, affordable, and standardized text- and data-mining services for licensed big datasets, as well as open and non-consumptive datasets too large or unwieldy to work with in existing research library environments. By sharing costs across a large number of academic libraries, CADRE will create a cloud-based solution for making these data available to its member institutions--with appropriate security, stewardship, and storage--at a fraction of what it would cost them to do alone.

This project is funded with IMLS award [LG-70-18-0202](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-18-0202-18) and is additionally supported by a unique group of cross-industry partners. CADRE’s core leadership team includes CADRE Director [Jaci Wilkinson ](https://libraries.indiana.edu/jaci-wilkinson) (Indiana University Libraries) and CADRE Co-Directors [Jamie V. Wittenberg](https://www.colorado.edu/libraries/jamie-wittenberg) (University of Colorado Boulder), [Patricia L. Mabry](https://www.healthpartners.com/institute/about/bios/patricia-l-mabry-phd/) (HealthPartners Institute), [Valentin Pentchev](https://iuni.iu.edu/about/people/person/valentin-pentchev) (Indiana University Network Science Institute), [Xiaoran Yan](https://iuni.iu.edu/about/people/person/xiaoran-yan) (Indiana University Network Science Institute), and [Robert Van Rennes](https://www.btaa.org/about/staff-directory) (Big Ten Academic Alliance).
