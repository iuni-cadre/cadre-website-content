**For immediate release:**  
**Feb. 10, 2020** -- The Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment (CADRE) will release the alpha version of its platform today in tandem with its [major workshop](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/cadre-workshop-iu) that will show researchers from any institution how to access and test the free tier of the platform during alpha.

===

CADRE’s [cloud-based platform](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre) provides sustainable, affordable, and standardized text- and data-mining services for licensed big datasets, as well as open and non-consumptive datasets too large or unwieldy to work with in existing research library environments. CADRE is currently seeded with the Web of Science (paid tier), Microsoft Academic Graph, and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office datasets.

The $2 million project began in 2018 with a [two-year National Leadership grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-18-0202-18) from the Institute For Museum and Library Services. CADRE is led by[ Indiana University Libraries](https://libraries.indiana.edu/), in partnership with the [Indiana University Network Science Institute](https://iuni.iu.edu/), and the [Big Ten Academic Alliance](https://www.btaa.org/).

![A collection of headshots of the CADRE leadership team.](CADRELeadership.jpg?classes=float-right)[CADRE’s core leadership team](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/the-team) includes CADRE Director [Jamie V. Wittenberg](https://libraries.indiana.edu/jamie-wittenberg) (IU Libraries) and CADRE Co-Directors [Patricia L. Mabry](https://www.healthpartners.com/institute/about/bios/patricia-l-mabry-phd/) (HealthPartners Institute), [Valentin Pentchev](https://iuni.iu.edu/about/people/person/valentin-pentchev) (IU Network Science Institute), [Xiaoran Yan](https://iuni.iu.edu/about/people/person/xiaoran-yan) (IU Network Science Institute), and [Robert Van Rennes](https://www.btaa.org/about/staff-directory) (Big Ten Academic Alliance).

CADRE’s Alpha Release (Version 0.1.0-Alpha) means users can begin working with Microsoft Academic Graph and using CADRE’s many features at no cost. CADRE’s [sponsoring partners](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) will additionally have access to the Web of Science.

“Over the past year, we have dedicated much of our resources to the creation of the CADRE platform and worked hand-in-hand with the CADRE Fellows,” said Pentchev, who leads [the technical team](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/the-team) building CADRE. “With this alpha release, we are unveiling the first pre-production version of the product. While a lot of components are still under development, we are confident that the alpha release presents a strong foundation with a variety of stable tools and useful features.”

“The Big Ten Academic Alliance is delighted with the progress being made with CADRE, as it’s another great example of what we can achieve when we work collaboratively,” added Van Rennes of the Big Ten Academic Alliance.

At today’s CADRE workshop, [CADRE: A One-Stop Shop for Scholarly Data Access, Sharing, and Reproducible Computation](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/cadre-workshop-iu), attendees will learn how to work with all of the CADRE features available to them in the alpha version of the platform, such as how to:

* Access open Microsoft Academic Graph datasets (or Web of Science for certain users)
* Query datasets with the CADRE Query Builder, CADRE’s user-friendly GUI query builder
* Code data-analysis and visualization tools in Jupyter Notebook
* Create a private space to store query outputs, data-analysis tools, and research results 
* Reproduce queries, data-analysis tools, derived data, research results, workflows, and visualizations in the Marketplace
* Reproduce analysis or visualizations shared by other researchers in the Marketplace

“Those who attended our [CADRE tutorial](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/rome) at the ISSI conference in Rome last fall will see a lot of familiar content, as well as some new features and product enhancements, such as package creation,“ noted Mabry, one of CADRE’s Co-Directors.

![The CADRE logo: A blue owl. Illustration.](CADRELogo_Small.png?classes=float-left)CADRE’s alpha testers will be asked to provide feedback on the platform’s functionality, which is crucial for informing CADRE’s continued development and ensuring the platform meets the needs of the broad [community of users ](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/blog/community-the-first-of-five-pillars-supporting-our-mission) it is intended to serve.

“While we learned a lot from our close collaboration with the fellows, we are eager for feedback from a broader audience, and that’s why we are doing an open release with the alpha version of the platform,” said Yan, who oversees the team’s interactions with CADRE Fellows.

CADRE will continue to provide intensive support to its [CADRE Fellows](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/news/meet-cadres-first-class-of-fellows)—the original, interdisciplinary group of researchers who provided use cases to the CADRE team by using the platform to advance their research. Fellows will begin presenting webinars on their work in March.
