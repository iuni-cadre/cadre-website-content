**For immediate release:**  
**April 6, 2020** -- In response to the [White House's call to action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/call-action-tech-community-new-machine-readable-covid-19-dataset/) for the scientific community to help solve important COVID-19 questions, the CADRE project has created the [Research Cohort for the Study of Coronaviruses](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/rcsc-program) (RCSC) fellowship program.

===

The RCSC Program gives any researcher working on COVID-19 or coronavirus-related research the opportunity to work in CADRE’s cloud-based platform and take advantage of a special tier of service. Research teams can consist of graduate students, staff, and faculty from any U.S. or non-U.S. university—teams can span any discipline and institution.

RCSC researchers will be able to:
* Query across the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) (CORD-19) of scholarly literature in its raw format and parsed into a relational database, which will be updated weekly
* Query across CADRE's Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph datasets
* Use CADRE's cloud-computing resources, GUI query-builder, and Jupyter Notebook coding environment
* Receive intensive technical support for their work
* Present their research in the CADRE Fellows Webinar Series

Currently, there is no deadline for proposal submissions, and we plan to accept RCSC research teams as we are able to provide support.

If you are interested in submitting a proposal, [you can do so here](https://iuni.iu.edu/resources/datasets/cadre/research-cohort-proposal-form). You can also read more about the [RCSC Program here](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/rcsc-program).

##### About CADRE
CADRE is an IMLS-funded, cloud-based platform that provides academic libraries and researchers with sustainable, affordable, and standardized text- and data-mining services for licensed big datasets, as well as open and non-consumptive datasets too large or unwieldy to work with in existing research library environments. The platform is currently in its alpha phase and any researchers [may test it](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/get-started). 

CADRE is led by the Indiana University Libraries in partnership with the Indiana University Network Science Institute and the Big Ten Academic Alliance. The project is also supported by [eight Big Ten Academic Alliance library partners](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us), the Web of Science Group, Microsoft Research, and the Midwest, South, and West Big Data Hubs.
