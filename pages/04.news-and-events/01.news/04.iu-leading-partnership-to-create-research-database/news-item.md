The funding will support the $2 million Shared BigData Gateway for Research Libraries, which will enable researchers to gain access to data through the cloud-based platform being created by a partnership led by the IU Libraries and IU Network Science Institute.

Additional funding is coming from eight other universities in the Big Ten, Big Ten Academic Alliance, National Science Foundation's Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs program, along with private companies: Microsoft Research and Clarivate Analytics.

"This project exemplifies the role of libraries in the information age," said Jamie Wittenberg, research data management librarian and head of scholarly communication at IU Libraries, who will direct the project. "Our mission is to efficiently and effectively connect researchers with the materials they need to advance innovation and discovery. The Shared BigData Gateway for Research Libraries will open up the power of data mining to everyone, not only people with specialized expertise."

The Shared BigData Gateway will also offer a "front door" to allow members to ask for bibliometric data analysis through an online form. The project aims to automate many required tasks to complete the research. Another feature allows the sharing of data, including software code, algorithms, methods and workflows.
