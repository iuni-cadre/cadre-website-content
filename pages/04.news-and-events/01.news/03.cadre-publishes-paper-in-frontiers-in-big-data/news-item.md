The Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment (CADRE) today published a paper in _[Frontiers in Big Data](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/big-data)_.

The article, called "[CADRE: A Collaborative, Cloud-Based Solution for Big Bibliographic Data Research in Academic Libraries](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2020.556282/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Big_Data&id=556282)," describes how CADRE helps libraries overcome the significant monetary and technical challenges of hosting big bibliographic datasets and empowers researchers to work with such data.

 ![Illustration. An image of a five-pillar structure with the words: Community, Access, Data-Centric, Reproducibility, and Empowerment written across each pillar.](updated%20pillars_smaller.png?classes=float-right) The authors discuss CADRE's cloud-based solution through the five pillars the project is built upon:
* Community: a community of libraries and industry partners who support and maintain the platform and a community of researchers who use it
* Access: the sharing platform should be accessible and affordable to both proprietary data customers and the general public
* Data-Centric: the platform is optimized for efficient and high-quality bibliographic data services, satisfying diverse data needs
* Reproducibility: the platform should be designed to foster and encourage reproducible research
* Empowerment: the platform should empower researchers to perform big data analytics on the hosted datasets
