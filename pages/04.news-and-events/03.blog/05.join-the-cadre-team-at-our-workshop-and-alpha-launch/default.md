**2/4/20**  
Next Monday, on Feb. 10, the CADRE team is holding [a workshop](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/cadre-workshop-iu) that will introduce attendees to our platform and take them through a tutorial of how to work with it.

![The date, time, location, and title for the workshop are listed. Illustration.](CADRE_SiteBanner%20%281%29.png?classes=float-right)The workshop will coincide with an exciting milestone for the CADRE team: the alpha launch of the platform! That means users can begin testing CADRE after the workshop.

CADRE’s [open datasets](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/available-datasets) will be free to access for all researchers. Any researchers from IU or one of CADRE’s Big Ten Academic Alliance [partner institutions](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) will additionally be able to work with the Web of Science data at no cost.

The best way to learn how to access and begin using CADRE is by attending the workshop! If you can’t make it in-person, you can attend online by using [the livestream link here](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/cadre-workshop-iu).

##### The workshop
The IU Network Science Institute's [Xiaoran Yan](https://iuni.iu.edu/about/people/person/xiaoran-yan), [Valentin Pentchev](https://iuni.iu.edu/about/people/person/valentin-pentchev), [Matthew Hutchinson](https://iuni.iu.edu/about/people/person/matthew-hutchinson), and [Filipi Silva](https://iuni.iu.edu/about/people/person/filipisilva) will present at the workshop by following a format similar to a Data Carpentries workshop. **Be sure to bring your laptop if you want to participate in the demos.**

At the workshop, you will:
1. Learn more about CADRE and what the alpha release means for potential users
2. Follow along with interactive demos and learn how to access CADRE’s open datasets
3. Create your first reproducible CADRE package with your own code or with someone else’s tools

Attendees will first learn more about CADRE’s [affordable standardized text- and data-mining services](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre) for big datasets and how the cloud-based platform can help them advance their research. Our team will then take attendees through CADRE’s innovative GUI-query builder, which allows users to easily query enormous datasets such as the Web of Science or Microsoft Academic Graph.

Attendees will also learn how to build reproducible packages from their query results and perform visualizations and use reproducible tools on their data. Once you’re familiar with the basics of CADRE, you will be ready to take advantage of our platform!
