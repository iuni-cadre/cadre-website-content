**4/2/20**  
The CADRE project has created a new fellowship program for researchers who are working on COVID-19 or coronavirus-related research during the pandemic. 

===

![A flyer with details about hte RCSC program.](Small_RCSC%20Flyer.png?classes=float-right)The program is called the [Research Cohort for the Study of Coronaviruses (RCSC)](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/rcsc-program).

Researchers in this program will be able to access and query across the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) (CORD-19) of scholarly literature, which CADRE has obtained and made available in raw format, as well as parsed into a relational database. The CADRE team will update the dataset weekly. 

You will additionally receive access to CADREâ€™s [Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/available-datasets) datasets. 

RCSC researchers will work with the CADRE resources available to everyone [during the alpha phase](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/news/cadre-launches-alpha-version-of-open-research-platform) -- including our GUI query-builder and Jupyter Notebook coding environment -- as well as receive an additional tier of support similar to what our current [CADRE Fellows](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship) receive. That tier includes intensive support from our IT team on your project and the opportunity to share your research in our fellows webinar series.

##### How to apply
If you are interested in applying to the program, fill out a short [research proposal form here](https://iuni.iu.edu/resources/datasets/cadre/research-cohort-proposal-form). 

Research teams applying can span any discipline and institution and include graduate students, staff, and faculty. There is no submission deadline for the RCSC Program, as we believe researchers working in this area want to begin working as soon as possible.

You can learn more about the RCSC Program [here](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/rcsc-program). Otherwise, [apply today](https://iuni.iu.edu/resources/datasets/cadre/research-cohort-proposal-form)!
