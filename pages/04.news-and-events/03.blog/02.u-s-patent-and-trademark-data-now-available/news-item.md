Last week, CADRE added the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) dataset to our server, making three different datasets readily available to CADRE users. The patent data will give CADRE users access to nearly 3.9 million records from 2004 to 2019, which include titles, abstracts, and referenced works.

===

We’ve also added the raw patent data into our server, which is 345GB. This USPTO data was processed by the [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center](https://cns.iu.edu/). Code to reproduce results can be [found here](https://github.com/cns-iu/uspto). 

The patent data will help scholars develop research around intellectual property, innovation, and more. CADRE users additionally have access to the Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph datasets, which contain over [220 million scientific publications](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/available-datasets).
 
Similar to the MAG dataset, the patent data is available to the public and can be used by any CADRE user. ![United States Patent and Trademark Office or "USPTO" logo.](uspto.jpg?classes=float-right)
 
IUNI Data Manager [Matthew Hutchinson](http://iuni.iu.edu/about/people/person/matthew-hutchinson) created documentation to show the different tables in the dataset and the relationships between them. You can can review that diagram [here](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/documentation/mag_core_erd%20(1).pdf). If you want to see the updated diagrams for all of CADRE’s datasets, visit our [Documentation page](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources/documentation). 
 
We plan to revise all of these database diagrams as we continue to develop a more user-friendly schema within our servers. 

##### More to come 
One of our CADRE Fellows recently received a dataset from Github. The data covers all [public activity on github.com](https://www.gharchive.org/) from January 2015 to December 2019. The data is part of the [GHTorrent project](http://ghtorrent.org/), which is researching software repositories. 

While we aren't currently planning to parse the data and add it to the platform, the CADRE team will consider incorporating it if users become increasingly interested. And we plan to add other datasets in the future as we continue to build CADRE to be platform that is beneficial to academic researchers from any discipline. 

If there is a dataset that you'd like to work with in CADRE, tell us more about it [in a user story](http://iuni.iu.edu/resources/cadre/user-stories).
