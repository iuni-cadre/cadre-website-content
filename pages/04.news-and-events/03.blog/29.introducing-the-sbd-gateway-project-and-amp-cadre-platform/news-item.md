The Shared BigData Gateway for Research Libraries (SBD-G) is a two-year IMLS-funded project to develop, seed, and maintain a cloud-based, extendable cyberinfrastructure for sharing large academic library data resources with a growing community of scholars.

SBD-G will achieve this through its platform, called The Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment (CADRE).

CADRE will initially be seeded with a combination of open and licensed bibliometric datasets, including Microsoft Academic and Web of Science data.

The project is led by [Indiana University Libraries](https://libraries.indiana.edu/) in collaboration with the [Indiana University Network Science Institute](https://iuni.iu.edu/), the [Pervasive Technology Institute](https://pti.iu.edu/centers/rt/index.html), and the [Big Ten Academic Alliance](https://www.btaa.org/). Additionally, the SBD-Gateway is proud to be partnering with:

* Michigan State University
* Microsoft Research
* Midwest Big Data Hub
* Ohio State University
* Penn State University
* Purdue University
* Rutgers University
* South Big Data Hub
* University of Iowa
* University of Michigan
* University of Minnesota
* Web of Science Group
* West Big Data Hub

To understand more about the value and complexity of these datasets, we encourage you to watch our short video on the subject:
