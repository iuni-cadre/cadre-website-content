**2/20/20**  
Last week, CADRE [launched the alpha version](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/news/cadre-launches-alpha-version-of-open-research-platform) of its platform, invited users to begin testing its resources, and held [a major workshop](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/cadre-workshop-iu) that helped users take the first steps on the platform.

===

This workshop was held in a Data Carpentries format, which included [a separate website](https://iuni-cadre.github.io/AlphaDemo/aio/index.html) with a full breakdown of the demonstrations and expected outcomes. The workshop was intended to provide concrete steps for how to begin working with the platform, which is important because users’ ability to work effectively with the platform will affect the quality of their feedback during CADRE’s alpha phase.

However, our presentations don’t end there. CADRE is lining up [fellows](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship) for its upcoming webinar series, which is set to begin in April. The first fellows to take the stage in the coming months are:
* **April 6:** Caroline Wagner and Xiaojing Cai present Assessing the Rise of China as a Scientific Nation
* **April 29:** Jane Payumo, Devin Higgins, Scout Calvert, Guangming He, and Anusha Manjunatha present  MCAP: Mapping Collaborations and Partnerships in SDG Research
* **June:** Yi Bu, Chao Min, and Ying Ding present Understanding Citation Impact of Scientific Publications Through Ego-Centered Citation Networks

[Stay tuned](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events) for the next round of webinar announcements about our fellows! You can view all the teams and read about their work here: [https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship)

##### Next milestones
![A slide that shows the CADRE milestones for 2020, listed in the following paragraphs.](CADREMilestones2.png?classes=float-right)In May, CADRE will both host its annual Product Owner Council meeting and help plan and attend the [Big Ten Academic Alliance Library Conference](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/big-ten-academic-alliance-conference).

That month we also plan to accomplish our next project milestones. The CADRE team will update and migrate the newest version of Microsoft Academic Graph in the platform and update the interface to accommodate user feedback during the alpha phase. We will additionally enable the public sharing of user tools, archives, and packages created on CADRE.

By October, [all three of our datasets](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/available-datasets) -- the Web of Science, Microsoft Academic Graph, and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data -- will be ready for our users to work with.

We will also establish a more user-friendly API with documentation. By this point, [all major features and datasets](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre) promised to users will be ready to test in our beta launch.

Every step of CADRE’s development means new capabilities for users, so don't miss any updates by [subscribing to our newsletter](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events) and [following us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project).
