**9/12/19**

Last week, the CADRE team presented our workshop and tutorial at the [2019 International Conference on Scientometrics & Infometrics](https://www.issi2019.org/) (ISSI).

===

Our workshop showed researchers how the platform can benefit science of science research work, including discussions on the importance of big data reproducibility and accessibility. CADRE Fellows [Michael Park](https://cadre.iu.edu/fellows/measuring-and-modeling-the-dynamics-of-science-using-the-cadre-platform), [Chao Min](https://cadre.iu.edu/fellows/understanding-citation-impact-of-scientific-publications-through-ego-centered-citation-networks), and [Samuel Hansen](https://cadre.iu.edu/fellows/systematic-over-time-study-of-the-similarities-and-differences-in-research-across-mathematics-and-the-sciences) all spoke about their research projects and the role CADRE would play in them.

CADRE Fellow [Yi Bu](https://cadre.iu.edu/fellows/understanding-citation-impact-of-scientific-publications-through-ego-centered-citation-networks) spoke at the tutorial, where attendees built a CADRE profile, queried the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset with our GUI query builder, performed analysis with simple code, reproduced their work, and even created a network visualization

Another CADRE Fellow, [Scout Calvert](https://cadre.iu.edu/fellows/mapping-collaborations-and-partnerships-in-sdg-research), wants you to know that being a CADRE Fellow is pretty great--and that [our owl is adorable](https://twitter.com/windloochie/status/1168508342165262337?s=20) . We can’t disagree:
