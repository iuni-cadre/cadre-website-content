The CADRE team is heading to the [2019 International Conference on Scientometrics & Infometrics](https://www.issi2019.org/) (ISSI) next week to present a workshop and tutorial to science of science researchers.

===

Both events will take place on Monday, Sept. 2, in the [Calasso Room](https://www.issi2019.org/detailed-venue-map) at Sapienza University in Rome. ![Red and white ISSI logo that reads: "ISSI"](issi-og-graph_web.jpg?classes=float-right)

These presentations will serve as CADRE’s introduction to an international community of researchers, who will be able to learn about and test the platform throughout the conference. 

Our team will use the workshop to show science of science researchers how they can utilize CADRE to collaborate with other researchers and reproduce work. Researchers will also hear from our [CADRE Fellows](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship) on how they’ll be using the platform for their fellowship research projects. 

In our tutorial, attendees will learn how to use all the fundamental CADRE functions. Researchers will start by building a CADRE profile and will then have the opportunity to query the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset with our innovative GUI query builder, perform analysis with simple code, reproduce their work, and more.
