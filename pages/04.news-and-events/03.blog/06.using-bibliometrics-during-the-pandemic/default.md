**6/29/20**  
Since news of COVID-19 first erupted early this year, scientists have been producing research around the virus at a rapid rate. Bibliometrics, a field that uses quantitative methods to analyze the research impact and quality of published works, provides invaluable insight during the pandemic, because it allows researchers to identify and study large-scale trends and patterns across the growing body of coronavirus research.

===

Here at CADRE, we’re utilizing the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) (CORD-19) to contribute research to the evolving COVID-19 research landscape.![A visualiztion of the coronavirus, which is round with small spokes emerging from it.](virus-resized.jpg?classes=float-right) 

We’re not alone in our efforts to foster increased bibliometric analysis of the current global pandemic. Researchers in [one study](https://www.cureus.com/articles/29507-a-bibliometric-analysis-of-covid-19-research-activity-a-call-for-increased-output), which analyzed the research activity around the virus between December 2019 and March 2020, said increased COVID-19 research is “essential for assessing pathogenic characteristics and developing novel treatment options” (Chahrour et al. 1).

A doctoral student in public health is [tracing our growing understanding](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-374) of COVID-19 and displaying gaps where we need to focus more, while a group of scientists are [creating interactive visualizations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06380.pdf) to easily browse COVID-19 research topics and resources (which you can find on the [Strategic Futures Laboratory website](http://strategicfutures.org/TopicMaps/COVID-19/dimensions.html)).

One team of researchers created an entire website dedicated to the study of COVID-19 with updates on new research papers, trends, and gaps. 

##### How CADRE Fellows help
After the White House created a call to action in March inviting the scientific community to use CORD-19 to answer questions about COVID-19, CADRE created its own Research Cohort for the Study of Coronaviruses ([RCSC](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/rcsc-program)). These fellows will contribute research about COVID-19 while taking advantage of CADRE’s resources.

Our [RCSC fellow teams](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/news/cadre-welcomes-researchers-into-its-research-cohort-for-the-study-of-coronaviruses) include:

**1. Science maps of research referenced in COVID-19 articles** from the Indiana University Network Science Institute and the University of São Paulo

These researchers will create a network-driven study and visualizations that summarizes the fields related to recent COVID-19 literature to help others find the most relevant and recent research in their field.

**2. Creating a map of COVID-19 research using neural embeddings: A retrospective approach** from Indiana University Bloomington

This project will create a map of papers on COVID-19 that will be compared with maps for similar viruses, such as SARS and influenza, to better understand unexplored and concentration areas in research. 

**3. Tracking and Recognizing Patterns of Communication, Search, and International Collaboration in COVID-19 Research** from Ohio State University, University of Hawaii at Manoa, and University of Technology Sydney

The research team plans to study the international collaborations that are forming to perform COVID-19 research, providing insight into research collaboration, teaming, and science dynamics during the pandemic.

**4. Study of Pandemic Publishing: How Scholarly Literature is Affected by COVID-19 Pandemic** from University of Michigan

This project will uncover the quality of COVID-19 related scholarly works by identifying signs of incoherency, irreproducibility, and haste to ensure researchers can find the balance between expediting publication timelines and maintaining research quality.
