Last week, we introduced you to the first of five pillars that define our ultimate goal. 

The pillar we wrote about, [Community](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/blog/community-the-first-of-five-pillars-supporting-our-mission), showed how our platform brings together diverse groups of builders and users to solve critical problems faced by academic libraries and researchers. If you haven’t read it, [check it out now](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/blog/community-the-first-of-five-pillars-supporting-our-mission).

Lack of resources, infrastructure, and coding ability are all major barriers that prevent academic libraries and researchers from accessing and utilizing big bibliometric datasets--potentially hindering the advancement of important research.

As we discussed last week, some academic libraries can’t afford to access big datasets. Even if libraries have sufficient funding to purchase the datasets, or if the data are freely available, many libraries don’t have the resources to host, clean, and update datasets, provide data security, or create a viable data-mining interface.

By providing an affordable, sustainable infrastructure for these libraries to take part in, we are solving a fundamental access issue. Additionally, the [tiered-pricing model](https://cadre.iu.edu/pricing) we plan to introduce will ensure that institutions of any size can afford to access CADRE’s services.

##### Access for researchers
CADRE reaches beyond libraries to provide broader access to individual users. Researchers who aren’t experienced coders are often unable to work directly with big data. We remove this barrier with our [intentional platform design](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/introduction). For example, the CADRE Query Builder’s graphical user interface makes querying millions of scientific publications effortless and allows users to easily export results to individual profiles.

CADRE also provides [platform features](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre) such as the notebook environment and the Research Asset Commons (RAC) Marketplace. These features facilitate reproducibility and collaboration and makes big data analysis more accessible for any researcher. Those researchers with programming experience can code their own data-analysis tools in the notebook and make their tools available in the RAC Marketplace for other researchers to utilize. The RAC Marketplace will also contain reproducible visualizations, research results, query outputs, and more.

We are working to add a free tier of service into our pricing model to grant even more expansive access to the platform. The free tier will allow anyone interested in developing research using big datasets, including members of the general public, to leverage the platform and avoid common obstacles. To protect every type of CADRE user, the platform will incorporate a federated login system.

So far we’ve covered two of the five pillars that define CADRE’s mission. If you want to catch the next one, be sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) so you can be the first to know about our latest blog posts.
