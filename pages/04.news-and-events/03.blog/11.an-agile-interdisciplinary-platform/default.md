Yesterday, CADRE Project Co-Director [Robert Van Rennes](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/the-team) presented a poster about our platform at the [Charleston Conference](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/charleston-conference) for libraries. The conference is just one of a broad range CADRE has attended to get the word out about our platform and get input on it.

Over the past few months, the CADRE team presented at events about the library and information science field, science of science research, and regional data science infrastructure to prove that CADRE can adapt to meet the needs of any researcher.

Van Rennes presented at the library conference to find out what these communities require from our platform and to share insight on how CADRE can help them, such as with our aim to solve academic libraries’ inability to afford the infrastructure needed to provide data stewardship for growing bibliometric datasets.

A week ago, CADRE presented another poster at the [Midwest Big Data Hub All Hands Meeting](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/midwest-big-data-hub-all-hands-conference). The Hub is one of CADRE’s [data infrastructure partners](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) and supports cross-sector partnerships that foster big data solutions to regional issues.

Similar to CADRE, the Hub was created as a result of the enormous and complex data collections that are accumulating without proper infrastructure in place to store, secure, and leverage the data. We showed attendees how our platform is built to do exactly that: We are creating an extensible and secure cyberinfrastructure to harness enormous datasets while also providing analysis services for academic researchers of any discipline who want to work with these data.![Two men explain an academic poster at a different session to another man.](MBDH_Conf.jpg?classes=float-right)

Not too long before the Midwest Big Data Hub event, we also [introduced our platform](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/cadre-workshop) to an international audience of researchers in a tutorial and workshop at the 2019 International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics.

There we [showed attendees](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/rome) how CADRE is critical in advancing informetrics and scientometrics research. Using CADRE, researchers can easily query millions of scientific publications within the [Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/available-datasets) datasets, build data-analysis tools, leverage tools or reproduce research created by other researchers, and collaborate on work.

##### Adapting across disciplines
A major part of creating an agile, interdisciplinary platform is offering datasets critical to a broad set of users. While CADRE began with the Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph datasets, and recently added [U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/blog/u-s-patent-and-trademark-data-now-available), we plan to continue to add datasets that our users, whatever discipline, tell us are critical for advancing their work.

Our [CADRE Fellowship Program](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship) also takes on fellows who are graduate students, staff, or faculty who span any discipline or institution.

Whether our fellows are studying [citation impact](https://cadre.iu.edu/fellows/understanding-citation-impact-of-scientific-publications-through-ego-centered-citation-networks) of scientific publications or [mapping global collaborations](https://cadre.iu.edu/fellows/mapping-collaborations-and-partnerships-in-sdg-research) in research, we believe molding our platform around a diverse set of fellows will help prepare us for future researchers who come from any discipline.

If you want to help us create a platform that will suit your needs, [submit a user story](http://iuni.iu.edu/resources/cadre/user-stories) telling us about your research and what you hope CADRE will do for you. Be sure to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) to find out where we are heading next to spread the word about CADRE.
