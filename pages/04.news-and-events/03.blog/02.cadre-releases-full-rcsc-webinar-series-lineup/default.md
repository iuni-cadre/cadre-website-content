**3/4/21**  
An exciting new webinar series featuring CADRE’s [Research Cohort for the Study of Coronaviruses](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/rcsc-program) (RCSC) is slated to begin this spring.

===

CADRE [established the RCSC](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/news/cadre-welcomes-researchers-into-its-research-cohort-for-the-study-of-coronaviruses) at the beginning of the pandemic to solve questions about COVID-19. Fellows received access to the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) of scholarly literature, the ability to query the dataset on the platform, and intensive support from our IT and research teams.

The RCSC teams investigated COVID-19 from a bibliometrics perspective: mapping and visualizing COVID-19 papers, tracing collaboration patterns in the research teams that formed to study the pandemic, and addressing the quality of publications about the virus.

Now, fellows will present the research they performed using CADRE.
