The Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment (CADRE) is extending the deadline to apply for the [CADRE Fellowship Program](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship) to June 25. Academic researchers and librarians from any institution are invited to apply.

If you are not familiar with CADRE, we are an IMLS-funded project that provides sustainable, affordable, and standardized data- and text-mining services for licensed big datasets, as well as open and non-consumptive datasets too large or unwieldy to work with in existing research library environments. CADRE offers academic researchers access to these data in a secure cloud-based platform.

The benefits of being a CADRE Fellow include: ![A graph that shows the Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph as two high rectangles next to each other.](Datasets-1.jpg?classes=float-right)

* Full travel support to present your work at ISSI 2019 in Rome this fall,
* Free and early access to our cloud-computing resources,
* Access to big bibliometric datasets, including the Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph,
* And training and technical support for the CADRE platform and for your project.

##### Fellowship Requirements
This fellowship program will help the CADRE team form expansive relationships with researchers, librarians, and data providers to gain critical feedback on developing the CADRE platform. As such, you do not need to have extensive programming experience to use CADRE. The platform will provide a user-friendly graphical user interface for data querying.

Applicants can form research teams consisting of graduate students, staff, and faculty from any U.S. or non-U.S. university—and teams can span any discipline and institution. You may also submit a research proposal without a team.

Sound interesting? Submit your CADRE Fellowship [proposal here](http://iuni.iu.edu/resources/cadre/fellowship-proposal-form) by June 25.

You can find more information about the [CADRE Fellowship Program here](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us/cadre-fellowship). Fellows will be selected the first week of July.
