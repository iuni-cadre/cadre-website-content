It’s been one year since CADRE began its mission of democratizing access to big bibliometric data for academic libraries and researchers.

Our two-year, [IMLS-funded project set](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-18-0202-18) out to develop, seed, and maintain a cloud-based, extendable cyberinfrastructure for sharing large academic library data resources. This sustainable and affordable solution would facilitate collaboration and reproducibility among researchers and allow any researcher to mine enormous datasets and analyze and visualize results. 

In the past year, we have laid the foundation for creating a platform that can provide these [much-needed resources](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/introduction). 

We began by developing a cloud-based infrastructure of virtual machines and copying the Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph datasets into the cloud. We then expanded our data platform to [allow secure access](http://iuni.iu.edu/resources/cadre/general-data-user) from our [BTAA partner institution](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) researchers.![CADRE's logo; a blue and purple owl wearing a birthday hat.

The [CADRE IT team](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/the-team) also created [CADRE’s website](https://cadre.iu.edu/) and a preliminary version of the Research Asset Commons and its web interface. All aspects of CADRE’s Research Asset Commons interface will continue to evolve to reflect changes in the platform’s development.

Plus, there were a few accomplishments  that exceeded our expectations, including the [CADRE Fellowship Program](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/news/meet-cadres-first-class-of-fellows) and our decision to broaden the scope of CADRE’s [datasets](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/available-datasets) past WoS and MAG in the future. Changes like these often come in the form of important [user stories](https://iuni.iu.edu/resources/cadre/user-stories) we receive about how to improve the platform. 

And of critical importance, we introduced you to our mascot, the [CADRE Owl](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/blog/meet-the-cadre-owl-logo) (who has [dressed up](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) for the festivities) and who will be featured in the [first CADRE newsletter](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events) launching today. 

##### What’s in store for year two?
By the beginning of 2020, CADRE plans to release a stable “pre-alpha” version of the platform. We still have a few important tasks to complete before we get there. 

Our next steps will be dedicated to finishing CADRE’s core technology, the Research Asset Commons, and everything that comes with it. That includes improving packages that allow users to [reproduce](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre) another researcher’s work, benchmarking graph databases for the GUI query-builder, and refining the querying process until we consider it the best solution out there--and one that can run near real-time.

Aside from building a platform, one of the promises of CADRE is empowering researchers by educating them about how to work with these technologies. Early next year, we’ll launch a [series of webinars](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources) about CADRE Fellow projects, platform and tool tutorials, and training on leveraging WoS and MAG datasets.

It has been a busy year indeed--and we still have features beyond these that we will continue to develop in line with [our mission](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/blog/whats-a-science-gateway).
