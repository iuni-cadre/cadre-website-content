title: 'Open resources and cloud-based tech during the pandemic and beyond'

COVID-19 sent students and faculty home, leading them to lose access to many on-campus library resources. By driving people to work remotely, however, the pandemic also prompted the opening of paid content and intensified the need for cloud-based technology.

By the end of April, content providers temporarily [opened access to over 100 paid academic resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1pFSA-yEDixl5ZKtQmEUOuW_vdDFLdzDbhjP5Cjrkajo/htmlview?usp=sharing) for the library community. Free datasets, such as C3.ai’s [COVID-19 Data Lake](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-publishes-covid-19-data-lake/) and the Kaggle [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) (CORD-19), emerged for researchers to take advantage of.

[Open access](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/blog/access-the-second-pillar-supporting-our-mission) to large academic library resources is one of the pillars of CADRE. Big datasets are sometimes too costly for libraries to purchase and those that can afford the data typically don’t have the resources to develop an infrastructure to make such data usable for researchers. To solve both issues we built CADRE with a community of [partner institutions that share the cost](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us) of dataset collection-building and of retaining the expertise required for data provisioning.

#### Cloud-based tech
The importance of cloud-based technologies also became evident during the pandemic. Many researchers need to be on campus to access big data from physical machines. CADRE allows users to work remotely on the platform through AWS Cloud.

Our cloud-based cyberinfrastructure ensures those working remotely can access licensed and open big datasets, as well as CADRE’s [querying and visualization tools](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre). 

We want CADRE’s cloud-based platform to be accessible to anyone, whether that means giving users the opportunity to perform big data analytics without local resources or providing them access to high-quality, standardized versions of datasets. Right now, [anyone can use CADRE](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/get-started) and work with the free Microsoft Academic Graph dataset. 

You can get started by checking out the free online demos and webinars [on our Resources page](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources) and join [our Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/cadreproject/shared_invite/zt-g66l6l4g-IQSJEYfQE4YeDA3ttsmdJQ) for community-based support .
