**3/20/20**  
CADRE has a lot of upcoming events we are hosting or taking part in. Due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation, we are seeing a few changes.

===

**Postponed**  
The Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) in-person spring meeting from March 30 to 31 [is cancelled](https://www.cni.org/news/cancelling-san-diego-member-meeting-march-30-31-virtual-spring-meeting-launched). Instead, virtual presentations will take place. CADRE is presenting a project briefing at CNI entitled “[Empowering Data-Driven Research through an Open, Accessible Data Infrastructure](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/empowering-data-driven-research-through-an-open-accessible-data-infrastructure).” 

We’ll keep you updated on when our presentation is rescheduled -- we plan to share the event recording!

**Still on**  
Since our [CADRE Fellows Webinar Series](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events) takes place online, all webinars will continue as scheduled. However, there will no longer be an option to attend these events in-person on IU’s campus.

The schedule is as follows:  
* April 6, 3 p.m. [Assessing the Rise of China as a Scientific Nation](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/fellows-webinar-assessing-the-rise-of-china-as-a-scientific-nation), our team from Ohio State University will present  
* April 29, 3 p.m. [MCAP: Mapping Collaborations and Partnerships in SDG Research](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/fellows-webinar-mapping-collaborations-and-partnerships-in-sdg-research), our team from Michigan State University will present  
* June 17, 10 a.m. [Understanding Citation Impact of Scientific Publications Through Ego-Centered Citation Networks](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/events/fellows-webinar-understanding-citation-impact-of-scientific-publications-through-ego-centered-citation-networks), our team from Indiana University and Nanjing University will present

##### Online resources for everyone
With many faculty, staff, and students currently working remotely, you’ll find you don’t need to be on campus to [access licensed or open big data](https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre/get-started) in an enclave or take advantage of CADRE’s standardized text- and -data mining services. Anyone can try CADRE during [our alpha phase](https://cadre.iu.edu/news-and-events/news/cadre-launches-alpha-version-of-open-research-platform).

All of our helpful demos, webinars, and informational videos about CADRE can also be found online on [our resources page](https://cadre.iu.edu/resources).
