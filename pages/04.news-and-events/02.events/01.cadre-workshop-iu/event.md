* Quickly export results to a personal space
* Code and reproduce data-analysisÂ tools, visualizations, and more 
* Work with a community of researchers

The workshop also coincides with CADRE's alpha launch, making this service available for free to all IU and [Big Ten Academic Alliance researchers](https://cadre.iu.edu/work-with-us).
