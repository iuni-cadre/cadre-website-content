Academic librarians are challenged to provide sustainable, affordable, and standardized data and texts mining cyberinfrastructure for large datasets. The Shared Big Data Gateway for Research Libraries is a two-year IMLS-funded project to develop, seed, and maintain cloud-based, extendable cyberinfrastructure for sharing large academic library data resources with a growing community of scholars.

Through collaboration with several Big Ten Academic Alliance institutions, Clarivate Analytics, and Microsoft, this project aims to offer a cloud-based platform solution for making licensed, big data sets available with appropriate security, storage, and stewardshipâ€”including Web of Science and Microsoft Academic Graph. This project was made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services LG-70-18-0202.

In this webinar presentation, members of the project team at Indiana University will describe their efforts to provide a cloud-based, platform solution available at scale, addressing the strengths, opportunities, and challenges of pursuing a network solution to a shared problem. They will also describe some of the use cases for these large datasets, including uses for researchers, administrators, and librarians.  

Given the enterprise nature of research data, this webinar will be of interest to research data management librarians, scholarly communications librarians as well as other institutional stakeholders including researchers, deans, research administrators, institutional researchers, eResources librarians, and IT professionals.
