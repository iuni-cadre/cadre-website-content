Join CADRE at the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) conference. 

===

CADRE's [Jamie Wittenberg](https://libraries.indiana.edu/jamie-wittenberg) (IU Libraries) will present a project briefing about CADRE called "Empowering Data-Driven Research through an Open, Accessible Data Infrastructure." She will talk about the important issues the CADRE project solves for bibliometric researchers and academic libraries working with research data -- her talk will be recorded. 

_Please note: The in-person CNI meeting [was cancelled](https://www.cni.org/news/cancelling-san-diego-member-meeting-march-30-31-virtual-spring-meeting-launched). This conference will be held virtually._

We will update this page once CADRE's presentation, as well as the other [CNI project briefings](https://www.cni.org/events/membership-meetings/upcoming-meeting/spring-2020/project-briefings-breakout-sessions-s20), have been rescheduled. 

**Abstract**: Bibliometric researchers and academic libraries are facing a research data crisis. Libraries that can afford to purchase big bibliometric datasets often canâ€™t afford to provide the necessary infrastructure to make the data usable, including services to host, clean, and update data, provide data security, or create a feasible data-mining interface. The Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment (CADRE), funded across nine university libraries from Big Ten Academic Alliance institutions, is building an affordable, cloud-based infrastructure that will accomplish all of these functions and give researchers better access to the data. By maintaining a shared infrastructure for standardized, high-quality data and promoting Digital Object Identifiers, CADRE will advance reproducibility in research and improve data provenance. Additionally, we will empower researchers to work with big data by offering a GUI query-builder for easy querying, a coding environment for creating data-analysis and visualization tools, a marketplace for sharing and reproducing tools and research, and a personal repository for saving results.
