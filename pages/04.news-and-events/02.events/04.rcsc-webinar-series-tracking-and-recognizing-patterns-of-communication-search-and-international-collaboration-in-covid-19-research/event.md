**Abstract:** COVID-19, a worldwide pandemic, has directed the attention of many researchers with relevant skills towards collaborative work to address the viral outbreak. The focused attention of research effort and the great demand for speedy results and international cooperation offers a rare opportunity to social scientists researching collaboration, teaming, and science dynamics. The extent of informal and ephemeral communications that are resulting in international collaborations and knowledge sharing to address COVID19 is a rare occurrence in science. The activity—and especially the urgent need to make the work openly available for broad access and international coordination—presents opportunity to study the formation of teams in real time.
