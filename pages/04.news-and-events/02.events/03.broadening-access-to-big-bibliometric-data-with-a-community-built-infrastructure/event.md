Join us at the [2020 Digital Library Federation Forum](https://forum2020.diglib.org/registration/) (DLF Forum), where the CADRE team will present a lightning talk.

===

**When:** November 9 at 6 p.m. ET  
**Brief Abstract:** Despite demand, academic libraries struggle to provide big bibliometric datasets for their patrons due to the cost and specialized expertise the datasets require. CADRE is a cloud-based platform for sharing, provisioning, and analyzing big bibliometric data. Libraries share CADRE development expenses to reduce per-library costs, while increasing access for patrons.
