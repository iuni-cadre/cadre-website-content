**About the research:** Researchers plan to determine the impact of the introduction and availability of long-distance flights on international scientific collaboration. The team will measure collaboration through co-authorship and co-affiliation.

They will also geocode publication affiliations from WoS and MAG from 1998 through 2017. This quasi-experimental research will apply state-of-the-art causal modeling techniques and explore how data-driven causality can enhance science of science policy relevance.

**Abstract (abbreviated):** The project will study the impact of long-haul flights availability/introduction on international scientific collaboration. The main advantage of the project will be the use of a quasi-experimental approach. Specifically, we will employ a discontinuity in the global air links network that results from regulatory requirements as identified by Campante & Yanagizawa-Drott in 2017 article published in The Quarterly Journal of Economics. Their analysis shows that cities that are just under 6,000 miles apart are distinctly more likely to have direct air links, compared with cities slightly above that threshold. This discontinuity—arguably exogenous—allowed them to use a quasi-experimental framework to analyse the causal relationship between air flights and economic development (using night lights satellite data) and business links (international firm ownership data). Our analysis will use a similar analytical framework to international scientific collaboration measured by co-a! uthorships and co-affiliations (with possible extension to citation networks and researcher mobility measured by changes of researchers’ affiliations). For this purpose, we will need to geocode affiliations of publications from Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and Web of Science (WOS) from 1989 (the earliest complete flight data available from International Civil Aviation Organization) to 2017 (the latest WOS data available from CADRE).

The proposed project is based on our previous collaboration that resulted in the paper “The impact of air transport availability on research collaboration: A case study of four universities” (accepted for the presentation at ISSI 2019 in Rome and under review in PLOS ONE). This initial work allowed us to identify gaps in the current literature and to provide empirical evidence based on cross-sectional analysis. However, the cross-sectional research design did not allow to make strong causal statements. The proposed CADRE fellowship project will overcome this shortcoming by applying state-of-the-art quasi-experimental design (regression discontinuity and instrumental variable estimation). In consequence, the proposed project will be essential for the development of our broader research agenda.

The need to apply a quasi-experimental approach to the science of science (SciSci) resaerch has been increasingly underlined (Jaffe 2002), also specifically in relation to scientific collaboration (Cooke & Hilton 2015; Hall et al. 2018). In a widely discussed article in Science, Fortunato et al. (2018) argue “Assessing causality is one of the most needed future developments in SciSci: Many descriptive studies reveal strong associations between structure and outcomes, but the extent to which a specific structure “causes” an outcome remains unexplored. Engaging in tighter partnerships with experimentalists, SciSci will be able to better identify associations discovered from models and large-scale data that have causal force to enrich their policy relevance. But experimenting on science may be the biggest challenge SciSci has yet to face. Running randomized, controlled trials that can alter outcomes for individuals or institutions of science, which are mostly supported by! tax dollars, is bound to elicit criticisms and pushback. Hence, we expect quasi-experimental approaches to prevail in SciSci investigations in the near future”.

Beyond the substantive research objective, the project will produce outcomes that will be valuable for other users of CADRE: two data sets of geocoded affiliations linked to WOS and MAG databases, and the shapefile of scientific spatial agglomerations (to deal with multiple affiliations in metropolitan areas) linked to the two above mentioned data sets.
