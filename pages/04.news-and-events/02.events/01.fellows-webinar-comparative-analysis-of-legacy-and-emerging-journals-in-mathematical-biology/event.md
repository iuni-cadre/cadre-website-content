Our fellowship team from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, will present their comparative analysis on papers published in mathematical biology legacy journals and newer journals.

===

**When:** September 23 at 3 p.m. ET  
**Where:** Online  
**Livestream link:** [Register for this meeting here](https://iu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAtf-6prjguGdNWF3YBuIBrue0zRgjnu3f_). After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.

**About the research**: Researchers will perform a comparative analysis on papers published in four mathematical biology legacy journals and on newer journals with different publication models and disciplinary scope.

The team will use the CADRE datasets to develop methodologies for comparative bibliometrics and content analyses; provide insight into publication trends in theoretical and applied domains; give authors new factors to consider when trying to publish; and help editors in similar disciplines use informatics to distinguish their journals.

**Abstract**: We propose a comparative analysis of papers published in four legacy journals focused on mathematical biology (Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, Journal of Theoretical Biology, Mathematical Biosciences and Journal of Mathematical Biology), and newer journals with different publication models and more disciplinary variety (PLoS Computational Biology and Journal of the Royal Society Interface) over a 15-year period.

We will look at several different factors: author analyses (including author publication trends), citation network analysis, a multi-factored content analysis of published papers (traditional analyses based on taxonomies for biological classification and methodologies, as well as topic modelling and machine learning-based analyses of textual content in abstracts), and editorial policies.

The results from these analyses will serve several purposes:
- Develop and test methodologies for comparative bibliometric and content analyses
- Provide insight into publication trends in theoretical and applied domains
- Give authors new factors to consider when determining the best route to publication
- Help editors in closely-related disciplines use informetrics to distinguish their journals

Our multidisciplinary team consists of librarians with subject expertise in biomedicine, biology and mathematics, and a faculty member with research focused on biometrology and mathematical biology. One member of our team, Samuel Hansen, has been working in-depth with the Web of Science data for some time. They used the Indiana University Generic XML Parser code published on GitHub to recreate the Web of Science PostgreSQL database for internal University of Michigan use before the public launch of CADRE. They bring a deep understanding of the database structure and the data it can provide.
