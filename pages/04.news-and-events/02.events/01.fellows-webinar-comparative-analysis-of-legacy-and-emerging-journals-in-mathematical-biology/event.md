Our fellowship team from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, will present their comparative analysis on papers published in mathematical biology legacy journals and newer journals.

===

**When:** September 23 at 3 p.m. ET  
**Where:** Online  
**Livestream link:** [Register for this meeting here](https://iu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAtf-6prjguGdNWF3YBuIBrue0zRgjnu3f_). After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.

**About the research**: Researchers will perform a comparative analysis on papers published in four mathematical biology legacy journals and on newer journals with different publication models and disciplinary scope.

The team will use the CADRE datasets to develop methodologies for comparative bibliometrics and content analyses; provide insight into publication trends in theoretical and applied domains; give authors new factors to consider when trying to publish; and help editors in similar disciplines use informatics to distinguish their journals.

**Abstract**
In this presentation, our team will provide an update our work to perform a comparative analysis on papers published in four mathematical biology legacy journals and on newer journals with different publication models and disciplinary scope. The presentation will include: the rationale and methods for the project, including a description of data sources, preliminary analyses of impact factors, citation patterns for journals and organizations, and topics. We conclude with a discussion of next steps for the project, and potential implications of our work for authors and editors. 

**Marisa Conte** is Associate Director of the Research and Informatics Unit at the Taubman Health Sciences Library.  In this role, she coordinates THL's engagement and facilitates collaborations in research and informatics initiatives. Marisa is also a PhD student in Health Infrastructures and Learning Systems in the Medical School’s Department of Learning Health Sciences.

**Samuel Hansen** is the Mathematics & Statistics Librarian at the University of Michigan, and also supports the Biostatistics department in the School of Public Health. Their professional interests include bibliometrics, research impact, database design, topic analysis, digital archiving, podcasts, network theory, open access, copyleft, science communication, and equity in STEM.

**Scott Martin** is the University of Michigan’s Biological Sciences Librarian. In this role, he serves as the library liaison to the departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) as well as the Museum of Natural History, the Museums of Paleontology and Zoology, the University Herbarium, and the U-M Biological Station.

**Santiago Schnell**, DPhil (Oxon), FRSC, is the interim chair of the Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology at the University of Michigan Medical School. He is also the John A. Jacquez Collegiate Professor of Physiology, and Professor of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, and a William K. Brehm Investigator at the Brehm Center for Diabetes Research.
