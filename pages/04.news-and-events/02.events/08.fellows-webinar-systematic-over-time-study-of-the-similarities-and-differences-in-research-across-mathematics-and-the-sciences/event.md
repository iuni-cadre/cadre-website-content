**Abstract:** In this webinar Samuel Hansen will present preliminary results from an in-depth study into the aging of citations in different disciplines from 1900-2017. Samuel will first explore a number of different metrics which demonstrate which disciplines have strong tendencies toward the use of older research, as well as those which skew strongly toward research that is contemporaneous. They will also introduce work into disciplinary differences for research that receives a large number of citations after years with little to none which uses the coefficient created by Ke, Ferrar, Radicchi, and Flammini. For both of these different approaches to studying the aging of citations a particular focus will be brought to bear on the differences which exists between the sciences and mathematics.
