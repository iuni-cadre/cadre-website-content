CADRE's presentation at ISSI 2019 will be on [Sept. 2](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/aa54ce_bcc5f1cb4cc44885985b462e7605333f.pdf) and will consist of a  workshop from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. CEST and a tutorial from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. CEST&mdash;so don't miss us! 

ISSI provides an opportunity to showcase CADRE to an international community of Scientometrics and Informetrics researchers, while also allowing us to receive essential feedback and use cases as we continue to develop a platform that suits the needs of every type of academic researcher.

Our [workshop](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/aa54ce_f0b1bbe0afde45af82a134f280fe03b1.pdf) consists of an overiview of what CADRE can offer SoS researchers and presentations from our [CADRE Fellows](https://cadre.iu.edu/website/grav/news-and-events/news/meet-cadres-first-class-of-fellows). In the hands-on CADRE [tutorial](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/aa54ce_dcb1f81d0a6f440bae592eab840754e3.pdf), we will show researchers how to navigate CADRE and how to access Microsoft Academic Graph using either assisted programming or the CADRE Query Builder, which uses a graphical user interface.

We will be tweeting about our presentation, so be sure to follow us at [@CADRE_Project](https://twitter.com/CADRE_Project) if you don't want to miss it.
