**About the research:** Researchers plan to determine the impact of the introduction and availability of long-distance flights on international scientific collaboration. The team will measure collaboration through co-authorship and co-affiliation.

They will also geocode publication affiliations from WoS and MAG from 1998 through 2017. This quasi-experimental research will apply state-of-the-art causal modeling techniques and explore how data-driven causality can enhance science of science policy relevance.

**Abstract:** We study the impact of long-haul flights availability/introduction on international scientific collaboration. The main advantage of the project is the use of a quasi-experimental approach. Specifically, we employ a discontinuity in the global air links network that results from regulatory requirements, as identified by Campante & Yanagizawa-Drott (2017). Their analysis shows that cities that are just under 6,000 miles apart are distinctly more likely to have direct air links, compared with cities slightly above that threshold. This discontinuity—arguably exogenous—allowed them to use a quasi-experimental framework to analyze the causal relationship between air flights and economic development (using night lights satellite data) and business links (international firm ownership data). Our analysis uses a similar analytical framework to international scientific collaboration measured by co-authorships, co-affiliations, and citations. For this purpose, we use geocoded affiliations of publications from Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and Web of Science (WOS), as well as flight data available from International Civil Aviation Organization. Our analysis covers the period from 1989 to 2017.
