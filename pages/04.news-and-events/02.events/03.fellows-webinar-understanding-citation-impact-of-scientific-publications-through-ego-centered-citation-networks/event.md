Our fellowship team from Indiana University Bloomington and Nanjing University will present the research they developed using CADRE in this webinar.

===

**When:** June 17, 10 a.m.  
**Where**: Online and Social Science Research Commons  
**Livestream link:** [https://iu.zoom.us/j/376407036](https://iu.zoom.us/j/376407036)

**About the research:**
The research team seeks to find the “deeper” and “broader” impact of network-based citation measurements in the scientific community. This project will determine the citation impact of scientific publications using an ego-centered citation network. Ego-centered citation networks contain the citing relationships between a publication and its citing publications, as well as the relationships within its citing publications. Researchers will use the entirety of the WoS and MAG data to establish empirical evidence in this project.

**Project abstract:**
Understanding the citation impact of a scientific publication is of importance in the science of science. Therefore, many different citation impact indicators/measurements have been proposed. These indicators/measurements are either number- (e.g., citation count, normalized citation count, etc.) or citation network-based (e.g., PageRank, EigenFactor, etc.). However, the current citation network-based measurements tend to ignore local details, e.g., the “deep” or “broad” impact in its scientific community, citing relationships between a publication's citing publications, etc. Understand these local details of a given publication from a perspective of citation networks can paint a more nuanced picture on how knowledge and citation impact of a certain publication diffuses and evolves dynamically and systematically. Thus, the current project proposes an ego-centered citation network (ECCN), which is a citation network containing the citing relationships (CRs) between a p! ublication and its citing publications, and CRs within its citing publications. By investigating ECCNs, the objective of this project is to understand the citation impact of scientific publications. This project is divided into three sections, namely topology, function, and application of ECCNs. The whole Web of Science and MAG datasets will be employed to establish empirical studies in this project.
