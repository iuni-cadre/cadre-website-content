**About the research: ** Samuelâ€™s project uses reference and citation aging, bibliographic coupling, and network breadth and depth to find similarities and differences between research fields in mathematics and the sciences.

Specifically, they will find how information ages differently across disciplines, generate data about changes in the development of these research fields, and study how actively collaborative the disciplines are. Samuel will use WoS data from 1900 to 2017 to perform these analyses, which have typically only been done on a smaller scale in a single discipline.

**Abstract:** The project I propose undertaking using CADRE is a systematic scientometric analysis of science and mathematics research using reference and citation aging, bibliographic coupling, and network breadth and depth in order to determine similarities and differences between research in different fields. Each of these analyses will supply important information about the nature of research. For example the aging analysis will provide in-depth information as to how information ages different across the sciences and mathematics, while using bibliometric coupling to compare reference lists for citation pairs will yield important data about the dynamics of research field development, and the network analysis will allow for a comprehensive look into the collaboration dynamics of the disciplines.   

While many of these analyses have been done at the smaller scale of single disciplines or selected years CADRE will allow for them to be done across disciplines with a time range of at least the 1900-2017 contained within Web of Science. More over this range of data means the analyses will return evidence of how research has changed over time. CADRE will also allow for the comparison of the analyses between the data contained in Web of Science and the Microsoft Academic Graph and therefore the results of this study will have a much stronger grounding than if a single data set was employed. This comparison between analysis between the two data sets will also provide for checks as to the quality of the data stored in CADRE too. In particular it will be an interesting test of how each database classifies the contents of it entries, with the much coarser Web of Science Categories versus the finer Fields of Study classification in the Microsoft Academic Graph.

It is worth noting I have already begun some of this study, with respect to entries classified as mathematics in Web of Science. In order to do this I used IU's (and CADRE's) generic XML parser to turn the University of Michigan's copy of the Clarivate Web of Science XML into a Postgresql copy of the Web of Science database which I run on a desktop machine. This means I have a deep understanding of the Web of Science data structure and schema housed in CADRE and can speak to indices and materialized views which have vastly improved my experience of the database. It also means I know this study is feasible under the current development status of CADRE since CADRE definitely offers more tools than a desktop.
