**About the research:**
The research team seeks to find the “deeper” and “broader” impact of network-based citation measurements in the scientific community. This project will determine the citation impact of scientific publications using an ego-centered citation network. Ego-centered citation networks contain the citing relationships between a publication and its citing publications, as well as the relationships within its citing publications. Researchers will use the entirety of the WoS and MAG data to establish empirical evidence in this project.

**Project abstract:**
 Breakthrough research plays an essential role in the advancement of science system. The identification and recognition of scientific breakthroughs is thus of extreme importance. We propose a citing-structure perspective for observing the unfolding of breakthrough research in the variations of knowledge structure. A series of network topology indictors are used to differentiate the citing networks of over 100 pairs of breakthrough papers and their control papers. 330 pairs of citing networks are subject to statistical tests for those indicators. The results show that compared with less ground-breaking papers, breakthrough papers show salient performance in terms of number of nodes, number of edges, average clustering coefficient, number of components, and average degree. Indicators such as network density, maximum betweenness centrality, and maximum closeness centrality, however, do not have a significantly discriminative power. It reveals that breakthrough papers have more connected citing networks than papers with less ground-breaking ideas. The characteristics have further been utilized for predicting scientific breakthroughs in the early stage.
