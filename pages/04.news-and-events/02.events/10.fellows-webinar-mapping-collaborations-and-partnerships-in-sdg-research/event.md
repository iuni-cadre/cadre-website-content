**About the research:** This project will build on the Web of Science report “Navigating the Structure of Research on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)." The researchers will support the United Nations’ SDG call for action in their search for patterns of global collaboration. Researchers will design a prototype to analyze and visualize the input-output of partnerships over time in SDG-supportive research. They also plan to create a scoring measure or partnership index that defines and conducts partnership analytics for SDGs by using data sourced from WoS and MAG.

**Project Abstract:**  
Extensive publication and citation data obtained through the Web of Science Group (WOS) has very recently helped uncover interesting trends in scientific outputs supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a shared blueprint for global partnership. This research, as a follow-up to the WOS report “Navigating the Structure of Research on Sustainable Development Goals,” aims to dive more deeply into patterns of collaboration, to gain insights for sustaining global partnerships. Are those collaborations resulting in co-creation, long-term collaborative research, or co-investment and equitable partnership? The WOS report found that intra- and inter-regional collaborations most often included European institutions, but how did these collaborations evolve and mature, and did this result in a true partnership? Specifically, this research will use co-authorship data sourced from WOS and Microsoft Academic Graph, in collaboration with CADRE and its community, to design a prototype to quantify, automate, visualize, and report output of partnerships over time in SDG-supportive research at the author and institutional levels. Through this research, we also hope to develop a scoring measure or partnership index supported with appropriate parameters that can be used to define and conduct partnership analytics related to SDGs and, by extension, to other topical themes using publications, patents, and funding data. Through this research, we also hope to contribute and enhance existing keywords and search terms for SDGs. This research supports the careful and strategic use and consumption of big data for insights, decision-making, and global development.
