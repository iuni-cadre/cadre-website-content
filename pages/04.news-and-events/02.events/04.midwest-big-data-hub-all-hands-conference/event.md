CADRE will be presenting a poster on Oct. 28 at the Midwest Big Data Hub All-Hands Meeting from noon to 1:30 p.m. CT. Come learn more about us!

===

The MBDH All-Hands meetings are organized annually to bring together the broad MBDH stakeholder community and interested new parties to share information on data and Data Science-related projects, collaborations, tools, practices, and discoveries in the thematic areas of interest in the MBDH region. The meeting is intended to build the community, share successes and opportunities, and to also provide engaging content on emergent Big Data applications across the industry-academia-government R&D space.
